## Overview
**PowerRails - A module to generate your scripts folder structure.**
![PowerRails logo](http://res.cloudinary.com/gatec21/image/upload/v1486397147/powerrails_ppxobl.svg)

## Why?
Most scripts/modules have a similar directory structure.
You shouldn't waste your time creating it. Just use this module to
get a head start and add to your new structure as needed.

**PowerRails will also helps you to become a better developer.**

## How?
We include the following helpers to keep you on track ðŸš† (pun intended).

- [Script Analyzer](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/development/RuleDocumentation) is a set of rules that are based on guidance from the PowerShell team. By default we enforce these rules.
- [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester/wiki) is a framework for running unit tests to execute and validate PowerShell commands. You should test your code. Pester helps you with that. Sample tests included.
- [PSake](http://psake.readthedocs.io/en/latest) is a build automation tool written in PowerShell. Builds glue everything together. Analyze your script, run your unit testing and deploy!
- [PSDeploy](http://ramblingcookiemonster.github.io/PSDeploy/) is a quick and dirty module that simplifies deployments. If everything checks out, deploy our script to where ever you'd like.

## Using PowerRails
There is only 1 cmdlet to learn. **New-PowerRailsItem**
PowerRails is semi-opinioned in the tabs vs spaces discussion. We prefer spaces but I've included
a switch to use tabs if you prefer.
